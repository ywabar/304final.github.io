            <p>One example is In the healthcare industry, Generative AI is changing the way we approach illness
                diagnosis
                and treatment planning. For example, AI systems may examine medical pictures such as X-rays or MRIs to
                discover anomalies, assisting in early illness identification. Another use of Generative AI is in the
                field
                of content creation, where it is used to write articles, create art, and even compose music. This
                technology
                can help in the creation of creative material, thereby increasing productivity and creativity.</p>

                title="Future of Generative AI">

            <p>Despite its promise, the complexity of medical data and the importance of health-related choices face
                substantial obstacles. Accuracy is critical since AI misinterpretations might lead to inaccurate
                diagnoses.
                Furthermore, because patient data is very sensitive, integrating AI into the healthcare system requires
                addressing privacy concerns. When it comes to generative AI in content production, the main issue is one
                of
                ethics and intellectual property. There is a danger that AI-generated material will infringe on current
                copyrights or produce content that is indistinguishable from human-created works. This calls into
                question
                the concept of uniqueness as well as the depreciation of human creativity. Furthermore, given the AI's
                reliance on the data it is trained on, ensuring that the AI-generated material is devoid of biases and
                mistakes is a substantial challenge. The use of Generative AI matters because it has the potential to
                transform a wide range of industries by enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and creativity. Early diagnosis
                in
                healthcare can save lives. It has the potential to democratize creativity and make content generating
                accessible to a larger audience in content development. </p>

            <p>The way we are able to look at Generative AI in different ethical lenses is by considering different
                perspectives when considering its uses and impact. Such Lenses can include Utilitarian Lens which we
                would
                consider whether Generative AI has an overall societal benefit or harm. We can consider whether or not
                it
                provides a positive impact on our daily productivity and efficiency leading to an increase or decrease
                of
                our social growth. Another lens we can look at is the Virtue based lenses. With this lens we consider
                whether the use of Generative AI can promote and highlight virtues such as honesty and integrity. We
                would
                look at the development of such AI and if we can cultivate such qualities within AI to ensure its
                development and usage is within positive societal values. The way we look at Generative AI within
                different
                ethical lenses is mainly based on perspective and the values we keep when considering its value and as
                such
                the societal impacts vary. Within different lenses we must consider how Generative AI can hit and miss
                certain expectations and we must be open minded in capturing it all. </p>
            <p>There are many recommendations we can suggest to uphold the integrity of Generative AI and to mitigate
                the
                potential harm of its use. We must ensure transparency between AI and the users. There are barriers
                between
                our understanding of AI and the process of how AI makes decisions. By investing more time into improved
                communication between AI and users we can break down this barrier to improve transparency and trust
                between
                both groups. Another method we can employ is the use of educating users with the capabilities and
                limitations of Generative AI. By doing so we can ensure users are aware of the potential and usability
                of
                the technology and to mitigate exceeding expectations. Another area we can consider is eliminating or
                mitigating the bias within AI algorithms. Generative AI can demonstrate non-biased responses can help
                promote fairness and be more open with the usage in different areas. In terms of policy related
                recommendations, we can consider implementing Ethical Design Practices. Implementing such practices can
                help
                designers with guidelines that will help them consider societal impacts and potential consequences with
                the
                development of such technology. </p>
